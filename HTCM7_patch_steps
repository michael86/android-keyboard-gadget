This patch is for the HTC ONE M7 running kernels 3.4.111 or 3.4.113

I used the source kernels cm-13.0 and cm14.1 from the below github, however, the following steps may or may not work on other kernels for the HTC M7
'''
https://github.com/9Lukas5/android_kernel_htc_msm8960
'''
Some of the below steps do require you to go into the files and manually add/edit lines, if you don't feel you can do this, then please don't attempt it. 

Step 1,

Download the patch kernel-3.10-nexus6.patch and place it within the root of your building enviroment. 

Step 2,

Run the following cmd 
'''
patch -p1 < kernel-3.10-nexus6.patch
'''
You should be greeted with the below print out.

Step 3,

Now navigate to the directory 
'''
drivers/usb/gadget/Makefile
'''
find the line 
'''
g_android-y	:= android.o
'''
Replace it with the below line and save
'''
g_android-y	:= android.o f_hid.o
'''
Step 4

Navigate to the file 
'''
drivers/usb/gadget/android.c
'''
Find the line 
'''
#include "f_accessory.c"
'''
Make a new line and add the following three lines 
'''
#include "f_hid.h"
#include "f_hid_android_keyboard.c"
#include "f_hid_android_mouse.c"

In the same file, find the line
'''
&audio_source_function,
'''
Create a new line, add the following and save the file. 
'''
&hid_function,
'''
Step 5,

Navigate to the file
'''
drivers/usb/gadget/f_hid.c
'''
find the line
'''
#include <linux/wait.h>
'''
create a new line, add the following line. 
'''
#include <linux/delay.h>
'''
In the same file, directly below 
'''
